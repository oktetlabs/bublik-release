# Highlights

## Run Diff

:::caution

This feature is experimental and may not work as expected

:::``

In this release we've added experimantal support for comparing two runs

<BrowserWindow>
  <img src={require('./img/run-diff-page.png').default} alt="Run diff page" />
</BrowserWindow>

You can now click on two run rows on runs page and select `Compare` button to compare them

<BrowserWindow>
  <img src={require('./img/runs-to-diff.png').default} alt="Runs selection" />
</BrowserWindow>

You can access this page via `Run` -> `Compare` button

<BrowserWindow>
  <img src={require('./img/compare-button.png').default} alt="Compare button" />
</BrowserWindow>

## History

You can now reset client side filters in history page

:::info

Sometimes client side filters _(click search)_ may not work as expected. In this case you can reset them by clicking on `Reset filters` button

:::

<BrowserWindow>
  <img
    src={require('./img/history-reset-filters.png').default}
    alt="History charts"
  />
</BrowserWindow>

<BrowserWindow>
  <img src={require('./img/history-charts.png').default} alt="History charts" />
</BrowserWindow>

We've also added a new page mode for history where you can see values change over time

<BrowserWindow>
  <img src={require('./img/history-charts.png').default} alt="History charts" />
</BrowserWindow>

You can click on chart point to bring up modal with additional information as well as ability to jump directly to log/measurements/run

<BrowserWindow>
  <img
    src={require('./img/history-chart-modal.png').default}
    alt="History charts"
  />
</BrowserWindow>

## New Datepicker

We've added new datepicker component with better accessability and keyboard navigation

<img src={require('./img/datepicker.png').default} alt="History charts" />

<img
  src={require('./img/date-range-picker.png').default}
  alt="History charts"
